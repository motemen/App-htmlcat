# NAME

htmlcat - stdin to your browser

# SYNOPSIS

    $ command-that-prints-to-stdout | htmlcat --exec=open

# DESCRIPTION

`htmlcat` renders stdin in HTML, by establishing a temporary HTTP server.

Requires modern browser that recognize Server-Sent Events <http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/>.

# FEATURES

 * Highlights ANSI code in HTML
 * Real-time stdin stream to browsers
 * Support for multiple clients

# OPTION

 * --exec=_command_

Invokes _command_ with the URL `htmlcat` listens as the only argument.
Typically a command which opens a browser would be useful.

 * --host=_host_, --port=_port_

Specifies the host or port to listen. Actually they are
handlerd by [Plack::Runner](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack::Runner), so `htmlcat` does nothing with them.
