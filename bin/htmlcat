=item --exec=I<command>

Invokes I<command> with the URL C<htmlcat> listens as the only argument.
Typically a command which opens a browser would be useful.

=item --host=I<host>, --port=I<port>

Specifies the host or port to listen. Actually they are
handlerd by L<Plack::Runner>, so C<htmlcat> does nothing with them.
